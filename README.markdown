##Installation

###What [Modulename] affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form. 

##Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing the fancy stuff with your module here. 

##Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.
